# Docker

An alternative to installing all dependencies locally is to use Docker Compose. The Docker Compose implementation will build an Opux image, start that as a container and link it with a MariaDB (MySQL) database container through a single command.

```
docker-compose up
```

This implementation requires the existence of a settings.json file in the same directory as you run the command from that it maps into the Opux container. It will also map a logs directory that contains all the log information normally generated by Opux. Finally, it utilizes a Docker volume and healthcheck for cross-platform compatibility and controlled startups, respectively.

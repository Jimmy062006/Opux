# Docker

An alternative to installing all dependencies locally is to use Docker Compose. The Docker Compose implementation will build an Opux2 image, start that as a container and link it with a MariaDB (MySQL) database container through a single command.

```
docker-compose up
```

This implementation requires the existence of the following files in the same directory as docker-compose.yml

* settings.custom.json - Your specific settings for the Opux2 bot
* authweb.config.json - Port definition for the AuthWeb server

It will also map a logs directory that contains all the log information normally generated by Opux. Finally, it utilizes a Docker volume and healthcheck for cross-platform compatibility and controlled startups, respectively.
